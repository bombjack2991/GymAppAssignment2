# GymAppAssignment2 Notes
-------------------------
- guys this is a public repository ahh so dont put any sensitive or secret information here. 
- because anyone can find this repository if they want. 
- and then now the general idea is a pet toy game + a gym exercise planner. 
- whenever you finish or accomplish a task, you will be rewarded with candy, pet food, etc. 
- and then by finish or accomplishing a task i mean you done your pre-planned workout. 
- like for example, you want to do 20 push up on saturday, and then you did it, and then reward. 
- so we should have one inventory system, which contains items. 
- and then a calendar/date/monthly/weekly planning system. 
- and then a toy/pet design.
